      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      //   let name = 'caglayan';
      //   let age = 33;
      //   let pro = true;

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      //   const team1 = players; // not copy like that

      //   // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //   team1[0] = 'caglayan'; // you changed original array

      //   // however what happens when we update that array?
      //   console.log(players);
      //   console.log(team1); // did you see ?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      //   const team2 = players.slice();

      //   team2[0] = 'caglayan';
      //   console.log(players);
      //   console.log(team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      //   const team3 = [].concat(players);
      //   team3[0] = 'caglayan';
      //   console.log(players);
      //   console.log(team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      //   const team4 = [...players];
      //   team4[0] = 'caglayan';
      //   console.log(players);
      //   console.log(team4);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const adam = { ...person };
      adam.name = 'caglayan';
      adam.age = 33;
      adam.info = { boy: 187, work: 'JS' };
      console.log(adam);
      console.log(person);
      //    PS: CAGLAYAN USE ES6
      //    PS: CAGLAYAN USE ES6
      //    PS: CAGLAYAN USE ES6

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
